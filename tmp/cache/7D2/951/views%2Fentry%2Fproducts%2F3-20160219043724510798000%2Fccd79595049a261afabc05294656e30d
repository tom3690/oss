 <h3>Rails Test Prescriptions</h3>
 <p>
               Rails Test Prescriptions</em> is a comprehensive guide to testing
                Rails applications, covering Test-Driven Development from both a
                theoretical perspective (why to test) and from a practical perspective
                (how to test effectively). It covers the core Rails testing tools and
                procedures for Rails 2 and Rails 3, and introduces popular add-ons,
                including Cucumber, Shoulda, Machinist, Mocha, and Rcov.
